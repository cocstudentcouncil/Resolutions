## Attendance

At the February 7th meeting of the Student Council at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech there were 19 students
in attendance.

## Meeting Resolutions
Each resolution will be prefixed with the number of members in attendance that support it. The most highly supported
resolutions will appear at the top of this document.

(15) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated
specifically for teaching assistant office hours space for 3000 and 4000 level classes which do not have labs. At the
time of writing this resolution, these classes' teaching assistants often have troubles finding consistent space. This
frustrates students who have difficulty finding help when they need it for assignments. Likewise, the difficulty finding
space frustrates the teaching assistants.

(13) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated for
general-use study space by students, and existing study spaces (such as "The Nest" in 346) should be refurbished and
made more accessible. This could include updating the furniture and/or updating the selection of books in its library,
which are relatively outdated for the most part. This would grant students more places to study collaboratively and
learn from one another while building a stronger sense of community within the college.

(13) Current study spaces need to have their furniture and equipment updated. For example, there is currently not a
functioning stapler by the printer in the commons. Additionally, the printer in the commons does not always function
properly, and cannot print in color.

(12) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, CoC Student Orgs should be able to book some
of the new space for meetings and/or events. This could be done through the Event Management System.

(10) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of this space should be allocated
toward a "maker space" which would allow students to check out and work with hardware devices. This would allow
students greater opportunities to work with real hardware in a collaborative setting, making them more skilled and
prepared to start careers which require such skills. This space could also allow hardware to be checked out, and this
system could be managed by student employees. The hardware available could include development boards for courses at
Tech, raspberry pis, arduinos, VR devices, etc. It is possible that funding for this could be secured through CAP.
Additionally, it seems that Troy Peace is currently working on a project similar to this, and these ideas might
dovetail nicely into that project.

(9) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated for
"breakout rooms" similar to those in the new library. This would allow students or organizations to book space for
meetings with low overhead. For example, it would make it easier for TA staffs to book space for interviews or for
students to reserve private space for group meetings.

Reasons we don’t like it: (14)
Locking down permission
Bounce problems
Transparency with moderation
Timing with moderation
Pictures not rendering
Secure Mail delivery
    Using more secure mailing list software (SYMPA does not support secure mail)
Redundancy
Privacy

lock down permissions a little better- no reply all
What’s the deal with the bounce problems? OEC’s been looking into what’s going wrong with it
No BCCing - FERPA violation
who is the moderator? What is the deal with moderation for CC News? Admin has issues with this
Grad students - permits issued for classes through a cc-news-and-events email via surveymonkey - what is the deal with this?
cc-news-and-events pictures never render
suggestion: send notifications/weekly digest through canvas? - weekly recap through canvas - figure something else out for daily communication - redundancy is awful
