## Attendance

At the February 7th meeting of the Student Council at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech there were 19 students
in attendance.

## Meeting Resolutions
Each resolution will be prefixed with the number of members in attendance that support it. The most highly supported
resoltions will appear at the top of this document.

Space

(15) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated
specifically for teaching assistant office hours space for 3000 and 4000 level classes which do not have labs. At the
time of writing this resolution, these classes' teaching assistants often have troubles finding consistent space.
Additionally, some of the space should be used for larger 1000 and 2000 level courses which currently need to share
rooms on the first floor, space permitting.

(12) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, CoC Student Orgs should be able to book some
of the new space for meetings and/or events. This could be done through the Event Management System.

(10) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of this space should be allocated
toward a "maker space" which would allow students to check out and work with hardware devices. This would allow
students greater opportunities to work with real hardware in a collaborative setting, making them more skilled and
prepared to start careers which require such skills. This space could also allow hardware to be checked out, and this
system could be managed by student employees. The hardware available could include development boards for courses at
Tech, arduinos, VR devices, etc.

(13) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated for
general-use study space by students, and existing study spaces (such as "The Nest" in 346) should be refurbished and
made more accessible. This could include updating the furniture and/or updating the selection of books in its library,
which are relatively outdated for the most part.

Makery - next to Troy - being made into a makerspace (just cleared out equipment) eg. a collaborative space, devboards, shelves with more recent textbooks, hardware set - raspberry pis, arduinos, - some locked cage, student employee/staff to check them out equipment
Collaborative study sessions
    Submit a request to CAP to get funding for this
    Proposition: have this downstairs for visibility and move TA labs upstairs
    Ping Anthony about space allocation maybe <- he would know who on campus allocates
    space

improve Nest atmosphere, repair, refurnish - expand
Printers and staplers - more equipment - reach out to facilities (maybe Anthony)
    Updated tables and chairs (13)

Breakout rooms like in the CULC with low overhead booking (9) - Interview rooms

cc-newsandevents Issues

(14) On the matter of the email-based communication channel in the CoC, cc-newsandevents, the following issues have been voted by the student community as ones to be addressed. 

1. Moderation transparency: There is little to no transparency in the email moderation process. The moderation process seems to take place at odd hours of the day and has been found to be the cause of delay in important CoC announcements reaching the student body in a timely manner.

2. Email bouncing and privacy: In recent incidents, undeliverable cc-newsandevents emails bounced and sent multiple error emails to the entire mailing list, which not only caused incovenience to the student community but exposed a student's private email address. The CoC should take steps to resolve this issue, including considering using a more secure mailing list server than SYMPA. 

4. Redundancy and spam: On average, the student body recieves between 2 - 4 separate emails from the mailing list server per day. The redundancy of news contained in emails along with their frequent dispatch reduces the effectiveness of the server in its function of keeping the CoC student body informed by frustrating its readers. The CoC should take steps to consolidate email information and curtail redundancy.
