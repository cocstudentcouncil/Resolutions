## Attendance

At the February 7th meeting of the Student Council at the College of Computing at Georgia Tech there were 19 students
in attendance.

## Meeting Resolutions
Each resolution will be prefixed with the number of members in attendance that support it. The most highly supported
resoltions will appear at the top of this document.

Space

(15) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated
specifically for teaching assistant office hours space for 3000 and 4000 level classes which do not have labs. At the
time of writing this resolution, these classes' teaching assistants often have troubles finding consistent space.
Additionally, some of the space should be used for larger 1000 and 2000 level courses which currently need to share
rooms on the first floor, space permitting.

(12) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, CoC Student Orgs should be able to book some
of the new space for meetings and/or events. This could be done through the Event Management System.

(10) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of this space should be allocated
toward a "maker space" which would allow students to check out and work with hardware devices. This would allow
students greater opportunities to work with real hardware in a collaborative setting, making them more skilled and
prepared to start careers which require such skills. This space could also allow hardware to be checked out, and this
system could be managed by student employees. The hardware available could include development boards for courses at
Tech, arduinos, VR devices, etc.

(13) On the matter of space being opened up on the third floor of the CoC, some of the space should be allocated for
general-use study space by students, and existing study spaces (such as "The Nest" in 346) should be refurbished and
made more accessible. This could include updating the furniture and/or updating the selection of books in its library,
which are relatively outdated for the most part.

Makery - next to Troy - being made into a makerspace (just cleared out equipment) eg. a collaborative space, devboards, shelves with more recent textbooks, hardware set - raspberry pis, arduinos, - some locked cage, student employee/staff to check them out equipment
Collaborative study sessions
    Submit a request to CAP to get funding for this
    Proposition: have this downstairs for visibility and move TA labs upstairs
    Ping Anthony about space allocation maybe <- he would know who on campus allocates
    space

improve Nest atmosphere, repair, refurnish - expand
Printers and staplers - more equipment - reach out to facilities (maybe Anthony)
    Updated tables and chairs (13)

Breakout rooms like in the CULC with low overhead booking (9) - Interview rooms


Dean Search
30 minutes block with 3-4 students - voice major concerns, how they were going to treat the student body - ask if this is happening
Student communication with Dean Finalists?
If the CoC having a seminar where they talk about each of the candidates? - livestream - event summary highlight

Cc News and Events
Reasons we don’t like it: (14)
Locking down permission
Bounce problems
Transparency with moderation
Timing with moderation
Pictures not rendering
Secure Mail delivery
    Using more secure mailing list software (SYMPA does not support secure mail)
Redundancy
Privacy

lock down permissions a little better- no reply all
What’s the deal with the bounce problems? OEC’s been looking into what’s going wrong with it
No BCCing - FERPA violation
who is the moderator? What is the deal with moderation for CC News? Admin has issues with this
Grad students - permits issued for classes through a cc-news-and-events email via surveymonkey - what is the deal with this?
cc-news-and-events pictures never render
suggestion: send notifications/weekly digest through canvas? - weekly recap through canvas - figure something else out for daily communication - redundancy is awful
